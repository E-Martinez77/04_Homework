// function to start the quiz

// click going to hide initial html, populating the questions, start timer click call function to do specific things; functions can be used for each individual task

// writing individual functions for the tasks and calling multiple functions within event listeners to test individual actions

// Comment out stuff as I go to test individual 

// Regardless of what I have always turn it in. 

// Conditional tree to determine right/wrong answer versus user selected(within function)

//8, 4 & 5, 20-23, 26, 27 & 28, STUDY THESE!!!!

//Biggest benefit, nail down the concepts we covered today. Look into local storage and understand how to get and save items from local storage and how to add the items that we retrieve to the page.
